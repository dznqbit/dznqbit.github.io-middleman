<div class='__description'>
As Totokaelo's sales volume increased so did their technical demands. I was brought on full time to improve and maintain our platform.
This platform was the "brain" of the business: eCommerce, point of sale, order fulfillment, CMS, CRM, reporting, receiving, etc.
<h3>Notable Responsibilities</h3>
<ul class='__responsibilities'>
<li>Building a sophisticated ordering/receiving workflow. The upload of one Product Order XLSX file would bulk create products in expectation of their delivery.</li>
<li>Improving the image upload process. Images would be tagged with product SKUs during the photo shoot through EXIF data; the upload of one zip file would bulk update products with appropriate images.</li>
<li>Updating responsive styling for our tablet/mobile users.</li>
<li>Revamping point of sale interface to allow for checkout via tablet/mobile.</li>
<li>Adding a "location" dimension to our inventory database, allowing us to scale from one store to many stores. This included assigning items to specific fulfillment centers while balancing minimum shipping cost and maximum customer satisfaction. Delivered on-time and well-tested in a critical period for our company.</li>
<li>Integrating our fulfillment pipeline with multiple Third Party Logistics vendors.</li>
<li>Tailoring our database for reporting via RJMetrics, and writing/administering reports for our accounting, merchant, sales, and logistics teams.</li>
<li>Collaborating with a third party vendor to migrate our product data, inventory, customer base, and sales history to their platform (Teamwork).</li>
<li>Implementing a Magento theme to present the eCommerce layer of the Teamwork integration over the course of one month.</li>
